# AOC 2021

This year I will try to solve some of the aoc challenges in the game mindustry with their processor logic. I have written a compiler that compiles to mindustry's logic assembly and adds some functionality like while, if, functions and better syntax for operations.

It may not work, because mindustry has several limitations. For example you can only save up to 512 values in a memory bank, you can't save strings in the memory bank, you can't edit strings, lists can only be done with memory bank or memory cell and the best processor executes 1500 operations per second.
